# Security Policy

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it
privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you
to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be
used before a patch is released.

You may submit the report in the following ways:

- send an email to brice.goglin@inria.fr; and/or
- send us a [private vulnerability report](https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc/security/advisories/new)

Please provide the following information in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact
- How to reproduce the issue

Security fixes will only be applied to active stable branches (usually the last two
stable branches, e.g. v2.9 and v2.8). Older branches might be considered if there is a
strong reason not to upgrade.
