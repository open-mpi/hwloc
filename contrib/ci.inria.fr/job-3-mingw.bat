call %JENKINS_CONFIG_DIR%\\ciprofile.bat

REM %MINGW32SH% and %MINGW64SH% should be defined on the slave to something like:
REM   C:\msys64\usr\bin\env MSYSTEM=MINGW32 HOME=%cd% /usr/bin/bash -li
REM (either in ciprofile.bat or custom Windows environment variables)

REM bashrc should then define $MSLIB32_PATH and $MSLIB64_PATH pointing to MSVC
REM lib.exe directory for 32/64 builds, such as:
REM export MSLIB32_PATH=/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/2019/Community/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.27.29110/bin/Hostx86/x86/
REM export MSLIB64_PATH=/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/2019/Community/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.27.29110/bin/Hostx64/x64/

REM bashrc also must make sure MSYS isn't going to rewrite lib.exe options
REM such as "/def:.libs/libhwloc.def" into Windows paths.
REM Can be avoided in MSYS2 with:
REM export MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL="/machine;/def;/out;/name"
